This model accurately locates regions of interest in the images captured by cameras installed on the road. Based on the coordinates provided by YOLOv5, the specific areas corresponding to the plates are extracted, facilitating further analysis.",
        "⚡ Once the plate region is identified, image processing techniques, such as adjustments to contrast, brightness, and sharpness, are applied to optimize detection quality. These enhancements ensure that the alphanumeric characters on the plates can be read more accurately.",
        "⚡ Character recognition was performed using tools like EasyOCR, which converted the processed images into alphanumeric text. This text was validated against a standard pattern to ensure compliance with the format of vehicle license plates. Additionally, the model was evaluated and fine-tuned using a ground truth dataset, allowing for accurate measurement of its precision and robustness under real-world conditions.",

The process begins with the detection of vehicles and license plates using pre-trained YOLO models. Vehicles are identified using yolov8n.pt, while license plates are detected using a dedicated license plate detector model.",
        "⚡ Once the vehicles and plates are detected, their positions and dimensions are tracked using the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm. This ensures accurate tracking of individual vehicles across video frames, even in complex traffic scenarios. The dimensions of the license plate in pixels, combined with its vertical position in the frame, are used to estimate the distance from the camera using a pre-calculated distance vector.",
        "⚡ The system calculates the vehicle's speed by measuring the apparent size of the license plate in subsequent frames, leveraging the relationship between the plate's size, its distance to the camera, and the frame rate of the video. This estimation, performed in real-time, is converted into kilometers per hour (km/h). The average speed of each vehicle is then displayed on the video frame alongside bounding boxes that indicate their position, providing a clear visualization of the traffic data.",

This transformation simplifies the geometric representation of the road, making lane boundaries more discernible and facilitating accurate lane tracking even in dynamic traffic conditions.",
        "⚡ The system also integrates a comprehensive pipeline of image pre-processing steps, including HSV filtering for color segmentation, grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur to minimize noise, and Canny edge detection to highlight lane boundaries. Additionally, region-of-interest (ROI) masking ensures that only the relevant road segments are analyzed, improving efficiency and accuracy. These techniques, combined with histogram-based lane line initialization and sliding window methods, allow the system to detect and track left, middle, and right lanes with high precision.",

Even under these conditions, the lane detection algorithm maintained robust performance, accurately identifying lanes and dynamically adapting to variations in road curvature and lighting. This approach ensures a reliable and efficient solution for lane detection in real-world driving environments.",
